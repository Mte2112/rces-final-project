### Project
I will be analyzing the influence of ENSO on climate variability in countries in South America. I will focus on Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina and analyze the relationship between ENSO/temperature and ENSO/precipitation. I am going to analyze the connection with PDSI to see whether temp or precip has more of an influence on PDSI in each country.

Lastly, I will see if/how major crop yields are impacted by ENSO conditions. The crops that I am planning on focusing on are maize, wheat, and oil palm. I am planning on incorporating cloud cover as another factor that affect crop success rate. The main thing I am want to focus on for this project is creating interesting visualization that demonstrates ENSO's impact on areas of South America and major crop yields.
