# Analyzing Trends in the Tropical Pacific
#### Fall 2020 RCES Final Project
#### Max Elling

##### Question: 
Are trends in the tropical Pacific signaling a slowing Walker Circulation?
##### Summary:

This was inspired by Clara Deser's 2010 paper "Twentieth century Tropical sea surface temperature trends revisited." Deser provides an analysis of trends in SST, SLP, cloudiness, and precipitation over the Tropical Pacific in the 20th century. The data provides evidence of a weakening Walker Circulation.

I used a similar approach to Deser to analyze trends in SST, SLP, cloudiness, and precipitation; however, there are some differences. I used the NOAA ERSST v5 SST dataset to uncover the differences in analysis between different datasets, and had an additional 12 years of data for cloudiness and SLP, and 6 for SST. Representations in my figures show similar trends to those in Deser's paper, but vary due to selection and breadth of datasets. 

##### Datasets:
- ICOADS 2 Degree Monthly Cloudiness (1900 - 2020)
- ICOADS 2 Degree Monthly Sea Level Pressure (1900 - 2020)
- NOAA ERSST v5 Monthly Mean SST (1920 - 2020)
- Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) (1950-2014)
