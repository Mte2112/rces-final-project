### Topic
I will be pursuing the question: Is the El Nino Southern Oscillation changing? I will analyze historical data on SST, SLP, and cloud cover to analyze shifts in ENSO. I am going to test this hypothesis by monitoring aspects that may suggest whether the Walker Circulation is intensifying or slowing over time. 

There is some existing research on this topic, but it is still debated whether warming will contribute to more El Nino-like conditions and the slowing of the Walker Circulation or more La Nina-like conditions. This is something I am interested in researching in the future, so I thought I would start by analyzing what has happened in the past to gain an understanding and practice my Python skills. 

Originally I spoke to Tim about a project regarding ENSO and crop yields in South America, but I decided I was more interested in this topic.
